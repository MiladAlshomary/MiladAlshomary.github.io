  abstract     = {{An argument is a constellation of premises reasoning towards a certain conclusion. The automatic generation of conclusions is becoming a very prominent task, raising the need for automatic measures to assess the quality of these generated conclusions. The SharedTask at the 9th Workshop on Argument Mining proposes a new task to assess the novelty and validity of a conclusion given a set of premises. In this paper, we present a multitask learning approach that transfers the knowledge learned from the natural language inference task to the tasks at hand. Evaluation results indicate the importance of both knowledge transfer and joint learning, placing our approach in the fifth place with strong results compared to baselines.}},

  abstract     = {{When engaging in argumentative discourse, skilled human debaters tailor
claims to the beliefs of the audience, to construct effective arguments.
Recently, the field of computational argumentation witnessed extensive effort
to address the automatic generation of arguments. However, existing approaches
do not perform any audience-specific adaptation. In this work, we aim to bridge
this gap by studying the task of belief-based claim generation: Given a
controversial topic and a set of beliefs, generate an argumentative claim
tailored to the beliefs. To tackle this task, we model the people's prior
beliefs through their stances on controversial topics and extend
state-of-the-art text generation models to generate claims conditioned on the
beliefs. Our automatic evaluation confirms the ability of our approach to adapt
claims to a set of given beliefs. In a manual study, we additionally evaluate
the generated claims in terms of informativeness and their likelihood to be
uttered by someone with a respective belief. Our results reveal the limitations
of modeling users' beliefs based on their stances, but demonstrate the
potential of encoding beliefs into argumentative texts, laying the ground for
future exploration of audience reach.}},

@inproceedings{10284,
  abstract     = {{We study text reuse related to Wikipedia at scale by compiling the first corpus of text reuse cases within Wikipedia as well as without (i.e., reuse of Wikipedia text in a sample of the Common Crawl). To discover reuse beyond verbatim copy and paste, we employ state-of-the-art text reuse detection technology, scaling it for the first time to process the entire Wikipedia as part of a distributed retrieval pipeline. We further report on a pilot analysis of the 100 million reuse cases inside, and the 1.6 million reuse cases outside Wikipedia that we discovered. Text reuse inside Wikipedia gives rise to new tasks such as article template induction, fixing quality flaws, or complementing Wikipedia's ontology. Text reuse outside Wikipedia yields a tangible metric for the emerging field of quantifying Wikipedia's influence on the web. To foster future research into these tasks, and for reproducibility's sake, the Wikipedia text reuse corpus and the retrieval pipeline are made freely available.}},
