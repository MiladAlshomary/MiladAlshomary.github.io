I gave a guest talk at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence at Leibniz University Hannover <a href="https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/en/institute/news/news-details/news/invited-talk-by-dr-milad-alshomary-on-tuesday-august-26-at-1600">(link)</a>. The talk covered my recent work on the explainability of authorship analysis models and how to make them robust for out-of-domain scenarios.
