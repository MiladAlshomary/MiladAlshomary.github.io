Excited to share that our paper, "Generalizable Analysis of Authorial Style by Leveraging All Transformer Layers," has been accepted at EMNLP2025 as a main conference paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2503.00958v2">(link)</a>.

We introduce a novel approach to address authorship analysis, showcasing state-of-the-art outcomes in out-of-domain scenarios while progressing towards more interpretable models. Looking forward to sharing more insights at the conference!
