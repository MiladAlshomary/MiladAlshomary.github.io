My name is Milad Alshomary, a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the Data Science Institute at Columbia University. I am working with Professor Kathleen McKeown and Professor Smaranda Muresan on author attribution and obfuscation and how to enable ML models to explain their decisions on these tasks. Before joining Columbia, I was a Ph.D. student in the Institute of Artificial Intelligence at Leibniz University Hannover, under the supervision of Henning Wachsmuth, where the focus of my research was on computational argumentation. My publications are on topics like the generation of argument conclusions and summaries, the generation of counter-arguments, and the tuning of argumentative content toward specific audiences.
