I am a PhD student and research assistant in the computational social science department at Paderborn University in Paderborn, Germany. I graduated from Damascus University and finished his master’s in Bauhaus University. In the realm of computational argumentation, I work on computationally modeling argument generation and on how to synthesize arguments in natural language texts.
